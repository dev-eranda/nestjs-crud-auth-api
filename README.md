## Project Backgroud and Overview
This repository contains back-end development work where built a secure authentication application using NestJS. This project helped me understand best practices in API security, modular architecture, and effective database management, while integrating advanced testing techniques
<hr />

## Project Goals
The main objectives of this application are to:

1. Implemented JWT-based authentication for securing API endpoints and managing user sessions
2. Developed a modular codebase using dependency injection and decorators in NestJS
3  Utilized PostgreSQL within a Docker environment to ensure efficient database management and deployment
4. Enabled CRUD operations to facilitate resource management within the application
5. Integrated end-to-end (e2e) testing using Pact to ensure the integrity and reliability of the application
